## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- Required Libraries:
  - `Pillow` (for image generation)
  - `instabot` (for uploading posts)
  - `requests` (for fetching quotes)
  - `python-dotenv` (to manage credentials)

Install dependencies using the requirements.txt file provided:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

### 2. Folder Structure

Ensure your project directory includes the following:

- **Backgrounds**: Place background image files (e.g., `Black.png`, `Grey.png`) in a folder named `Backgrounds/`.
- **Fonts**: Include your chosen font files (e.g., `Anantason-Bold.ttf`) in a folder named `Fonts/`.
- **credentials.env**: Store your Instagram username and password.

Example `credentials.env`:

```env
INSTA_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
INSTA_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
```

### 3. Run the Project

Use the `Main.py` script to run the entire workflow:

```bash
python Main.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Fetch a Quote**: Automatically fetches a random motivational quote and author.
2. **Create Post**: Generates a quote image with dynamic font color and backgrounds.
3. **Prepare Caption**:
   - Adds a motivational call-to-action (CTA).
   - Randomly selects hashtags from the predefined list.
4. **Upload to Instagram**: The generated post is uploaded with the caption.

## Customization

- **Backgrounds**: Add more images in the `Backgrounds/` folder.
- **Fonts**: Use your preferred `.ttf` or `.otf` fonts.
- **Quotes**: Replace or enhance the quote source as needed.
- **Captions**: Modify the hashtags and call-to-action in `Designs.py` or `Main.py`.

---

## Error Handling

- **Rate Limit**: If the ZenQuotes API exceeds its request limit, the program stops execution with a clear error message.
- **Missing Credentials**: Ensures credentials are securely loaded via `credentials.env`.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add dynamic hashtag generation.
- Support for scheduling posts.
- Enhance API error handling for other edge cases.
